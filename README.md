#### Description:
For my final project, I decided to create a simple yet engaging minigame called "Flip Game." The Flip Game is a matching game where players select two cards at a time, attempting to find pairs with the same ID. If a pair is found, the cards remain flipped to their front side, indicating they have been discovered. If the selected cards do not match, they revert to their original, unflipped state. The game continues in this manner until all cards have been successfully matched and revealed. To add a competitive element, the game includes a counter that tracks the number of attempts made by the player to match the cards.
In terms of the theme, I chose Pokémon, specifically featuring a variety of Pokémon from the Kanto region. This decision was inspired by my fond memories of the Pokémon anime from my childhood, and I thought it would be fun and nostalgic to integrate these characters into my project.
For the development of the game, I opted to use React.js with Vite. React.js is a powerful library for building user interfaces, particularly interactive ones like this game. Vite, on the other hand, is a build tool that significantly enhances the development experience by providing faster builds and a more efficient development server. Together, React.js and Vite allowed me to manage the game's state and interactions seamlessly, making the development process more streamlined and efficient.
To handle the styling of the game, I utilized Tailwind CSS. Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of predefined classes directly in the HTML, allowing for rapid and clean styling. Using Tailwind, I was able to easily apply and manage styles, ensuring the game not only functions well but also look aesthetically pleasing. The use of Tailwind contributed to cleaner and more maintainable code, which is especially beneficial in a project like this where the visual presentation is crucial.
Finally, for hosting the project, I chose Vercel. Vercel is a serverless platform ideal for deploying frontend applications. It offers an excellent environment for hosting web projects, providing fast and reliable performance without the need for managing servers or databases. While Vercel does not support backend functionalities or databases, it is perfectly suited for a static site like my Flip Game, which primarily involves client-side logic and rendering.

The combination of React.js with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Vercel allowed me to develop and deploy my Flip Game efficiently and effectively. The game now stands as a nostalgic and enjoyable experience for players, allowing them to relive their memories of Pokémon while engaging in a fun matching challenge. The use of modern web development tools and platforms ensured that the project was not only fun to create but also robust and performant for the end-users. Through this project, I have gained valuable experience in full-stack development, from design and development to deployment and hosting, all while creating something enjoyable and meaningful.
